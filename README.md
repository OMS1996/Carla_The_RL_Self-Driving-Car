# Carla the Reinforcement Self-Driving-Car (Version Morra)
In this project I aim to create a self-driving car that uses a reinforcement learning approach to navigate in an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research called Carla. The data that the car will use as to guide its decision is image data in the `RGB` format and `collision` data.
